About Me
========

Education
---------

I graduated from the graduate and undergraduate programs from the
National University Of Singapore (NUS) under the Concurrent Degree
Program for Psychology Majors. My thesis was in the domain of
Quantitative Psychology, which is focused on the application of
statistical techniques to the study of Psychology. My research topic
evaluated different missing data techniques when applied to joint
ordinal-continuous measurement models. I suffer frequent identity crises
as I contemplate the fact that I know too little statistics to
confidently call myself a statistician but also do too little psychology
to call myself a psychologist.

Career
------

I have had numerous internships and work experience in the Public
Sector, I was also a research assistant in the Psycholinguistics Lab at
NUS. More information can be found on my
